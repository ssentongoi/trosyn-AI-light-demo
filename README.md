📦 GitHub Repository Description
Trosyn Light – Offline AI Document Assistant (Gemma 3n Impact Challenge)
Trosyn Light is a privacy-first, offline-capable document editor powered by Gemma 3n 1B (via llama.cpp). Designed for low-resource environments, it brings powerful AI writing support — including summarization, redaction, and rewriting — to users without requiring an internet connection.

“AI writing where the cloud can’t reach.”


Key Features:

📝 Editor.js-based document editing with offline persistence

🧠 Local AI agents for summarization and cleanup using Gemma 3n

🔐 No cloud, no tracking — runs fully offline on-device

🖥️ Built with Electron + Node.js for cross-platform desktop use

🧩 Modular agent system for scalable document intelligence


Target Users:

Field workers in NGOs, government, legal, and education

Organizations in low-connectivity regions

Teams needing air-gapped or internal-only document workflows

Note: This is a stripped-down MVP for evaluation purposes only. Final release will include version control, departmental agent packs (HR, Finance, etc.), and full agent supervision.

Would you like me to also generate the README.md file based on this structure with setup instructions, screenshots, and license note?
