# Trosyn-AI
Trosyn AI is an offline-first, self-hosted AI system that allows companies to implement AI across their departments. It features a central admin hub and multiple department-specific apps (“child nodes”), each embedded with its own AI assistant that only accesses locally stored internal data.
