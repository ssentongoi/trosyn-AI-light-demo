Future Feature: Local AI Agents

Coming soon: downloadable AI agents that automate multi-step tasks—for example:
	•	HR Agent: Reviews incoming resumes, matches skills to roles, and pre-summarizes candidates.
	•	Finance Agent: Monitors expense reports, flags anomalies, drafts summaries for review.
	•	Legal Agent: Scans contracts for key clauses, redacts sensitive info, and highlights risks.

Agents run locally, are department-specific and optionally installed. Full admin control, no cloud needed.

Use Cases
	•	HR: Upload interview notes → get clean, precise summaries.
	•	Legal: Process contracts → redact and extract key clauses offline.
	•	Finance: Load quarterly reports → ask, “What spiked this month?” Get instant answers.

Upgradeable over time with connectors or agent modules when approved by your admin.
