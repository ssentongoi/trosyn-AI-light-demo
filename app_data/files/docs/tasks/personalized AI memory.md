personalized AI memory and context per user/device, something like:

The AI knows the user’s name and role

Remembers past interactions

Tracks departmental focus or recent documents

Can say things like “Welcome back, Ivan. You were last reviewing HR policies.”

You're basically building a lightweight, per-user contextual memory system. This is useful, and here’s a breakdown of how to implement it offline, how to store it, and whether or not you need to back it up.

🔧 How to Implement a Local Personalized System 
📦 Structure
Each device (or user profile on a device) stores a small memory JSON locally:

json

{
  "user_id": "ivan123",
  "name": "Ivan",
  "role": "HR Officer",
  "last_topic": "HR Onboarding",
  "last_query": "Draft checklist for new hires",
  "preferences": {
    "voice": "formal",
    "assistant_mode": "summary-first"
  },
  "usage_stats": {
    "sessions": 21,
    "last_active": "2025-06-15T18:33Z"
  }
}
This file lives in:

~/.trosyn_ai/memory.json (or similar path)

Max size: under 1 MB per user

✅ Benefits
Personalized interactions feel more helpful

Increases productivity by remembering context

Makes the AI feel like a real assistant, not a reset toy

🧠 What It Remembers
Name, title, department

Last 3–5 topics or queries

Project focus (e.g. Finance Audit)

Language/style preferences

Local device usage patterns

🔐 Privacy & Security
File is only on that specific device

AES-256 encrypted (optional)

No sync to other devices unless user manually exports it

💾 Do You Need to Back It Up?
You don’t need to back it up unless:

The user wants to migrate to another machine

You're enabling persistent memory across reinstalls

Suggested Plan:
Let users export memory manually (e.g., to flash disk)

Add a toggle in settings: Export/Import Personal Memory

📅 Implementation Timing
This fits perfectly into MVP 4 or MVP 5 (Q1 2026), after core system stability and multi-user access are proven.

🚧 Implementation Notes
Use a small local JSON file per user

Memory is loaded into RAM on AI boot, used to prime prompts

Use a small local rule engine or summarizer to decay old data

Encrypt file if needed with user PIN or device ID

⚠️ Avoid This
Don’t sync it to Superadmin (violates your privacy rule)

Don’t mix this memory with shared department memory
