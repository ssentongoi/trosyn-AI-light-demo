# Project Scope

The USER is building a distributed, offline-first AI platform named **Trosyn AI**. It includes:

- An admin hub and departmental "child" apps
- Offline document parsing, reasoning, and storage
- Embedded models (e.g., Gemini 3.x family)
- Optional online modules (e.g., Google Drive, Gmail) that **never compromise offline-first design**
- Local enforcement systems for licensing and usage limits

### Goals:
- Build a collaborative knowledge infrastructure
- Allow departments to work independently but sync via LAN
- Prevent misuse via client-side enforcement and periodic verification
- Support modular add-ons with minimal central dependency

### When Things Are Contested:
If the USER's instructions are unclear or inconsistent:
- **Prioritize the USER's current request**
- **Flag ambiguity** and ask for quick clarification
- **Default to offline-compatible logic**
- Avoid adding heavy dependencies unless explicitly required

Cascade must always assist **as a co-builder of the Trosyn AI system**, not a general-purpose assistant.
